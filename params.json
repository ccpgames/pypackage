Instead there would only be a static\r\nmetadata file. In the distribution version of the package, the inverse\r\nwould be true.\r\n\r\nExample, write Python and send it to PyPI\r\n-----------------------------------------\r\n\r\nFirst, [configure your \\~/.pypirc\r\nfile](https://docs.python.org/2/distutils/packageindex.html#pypirc) with\r\na `[pypi]` section if you haven't already. Now, assuming you lay out\r\nyour project something like:\r\n\r\n    ./your_project\r\n    ./your_project/README.md\r\n    ./your_project/pypackage.meta\r\n    ./your_project/...\r\n    ./your_project/your_project/__init__.py\r\n    ./your_project/your_project/your_code.py\r\n    ./your_project/your_project/...\r\n\r\nWith pypackage installed, from `./your_project` run the following\r\ncommands to send your project to PyPI for the first time:\r\n\r\n``` {.sourceCode .bash}\r\n$ py-build\r\n$ py-build -s\r\n$ python setup.py register\r\n$ twine upload dist/* || pip install twine && twine upload dist/*\r\n```\r\n\r\nEvery time after that, to update your package is a two step process:\r\n\r\n``` {.sourceCode .bash}\r\n$ py-build\r\n$ twine upload dist/*\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will upload a binary wheel and source distribution to PyPI, so you\r\ncan share your work with the world.\r\n\r\nThe source distribution will include a `setup.py` and will not include\r\nthe `pypackage.meta` if you use one. In this way, Pypackage does not\r\ncreate a build dependency on your distribution, but rather only on your\r\nsource, or perhaps more specifically, your build chain and/or\r\ndevelopment environment. (Unless you choose to develop off of the\r\ndistributed source version, then carry on doing your thing.)\r\n\r\nJust don't submit any patches to the `setup.py`, because it's not a real\r\nthing in the source. As a project maintainer, you may even consider\r\nadding `setup.py` to the `.gitignore` of your pypackaged projects.\r\n\r\npypackage.meta\r\n--------------\r\n\r\nPypackage uses the `pypackage.meta` file in your project to fill in any\r\ndetails that it would otherwise not be able to guess. It is a JSON\r\nformatted file which can have any of the `setuptools` or `distutils`\r\nsetup kwargs as key/value pairs.\r\n\r\nIt also has a few extra keys to extend the functionality of setuptools\r\n(most notably to support the `source_label` and `source_url` parameters,\r\nmentioned in [PEP426](http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0426/)).\r\n\r\nBelow is an example of a fully-featured `pypackage.meta` file. (For a\r\ncomplete list of all available keys, they are the `_KEYS` and\r\n`_PYPACKAGE_KEYS` OrderedDicts found in the `Config` object; [view the\r\nsource](https://github.com/ccpgames/pypackage/blob/master/pypackage/config.py)):\r\n\r\n``` {.sourceCode .meta}\r\n{\r\n    # single line comments like so are allowed in the pypackage.meta\r\n    # but if py-build remakes the meta (-m flag) the comments will be removed\r\n\r\n    # name, if not provided, is guessed from the current directory name\r\n    \"name\": \"demo-package\",\r\n\r\n    # version, if not provided, is searched for in your source code\r\n    \"version\": \"1.0.1\",\r\n\r\n    # description becomes long_description as well unless long_description is also set\r\n    \"description\": \"This is a demo package\",\r\n\r\n    # filenames can also be used for long_description, relative path from package root\r\n    \"long_description\": \"README.md\",\r\n\r\n    \"author\": \"Your name here\",\r\n    \"author_email\": \"yourname@yourcompany.com\",\r\n\r\n    # if author is provided but maintainer is not, maintainer becomes author\r\n    \"maintainer\": \"Someone else\",\r\n    \"maintainer_email\": \"someoneelse@yourcompany.com\",\r\n\r\n    \"url\": \"http://yourcompany.com/yourproject\",\r\n    \"download_url\": \"http://yourcompany.com/releases/yourproject\",\r\n\r\n    # for packages, you can either provide a list of package names, use\r\n    # find_packages() with your own args/kwargs, or use pypackage's defaults.\r\n    # for instance, both of these are valid for packages:\r\n    \"packages\": [\"your_package\"],\r\n    # \"packages\": [\"find_packages(exclude=['examples', 'tests'])\"],\r\n    # if not provided, this is the default for packages:\r\n    # \"packages\": [\"find_packages(exclude=['test', 'tests'])\"],\r\n\r\n    # py_modules can be used to install top level python modules, but it will\r\n    # also be guessed at and included if not provided (any top level .py file\r\n    # is included by pypackage's guesswork).\r\n    \"py_modules\": [\"demo_module\"],\r\n\r\n    # scripts may be provided as relative file paths, or if not provided, pypackage\r\n    # will guess at them. any file in either `bin` or `scripts` directory down\r\n    # from the package root will be included (on windows) or any executable file\r\n    # in those directories are included when building on anything that's not windows.\r\n    \"scripts\": [\"bin/demo_script\"],\r\n\r\n    # entry_points are the same syntax as you're used to. pypackage makes no guesses at these\r\n    \"entry_points\": {\"paste.app_factory\": [\"main = demo_package.web:paste\"]},\r\n\r\n    # a list of packages to be installed when your package is installed\r\n    \"install_requires\": [\"requests > 1.0.0\"],\r\n\r\n    # a list of packages to be installed when your package is tested\r\n    # note if you're using test_runner you don't have to include the runner or coverage\r\n    \"tests_require\": [\"twisted > 15.0.0\"],\r\n\r\n    # list of python classifiers. you can run `py-build -R` to forcibly (re)enter\r\n    # the curses classifiers selection process\r\n    \"classifiers\": [\r\n        \"Development Status :: 4 - Beta\",\r\n        \"Environment :: Web Environment\"\r\n    ],\r\n\r\n    # ~~ PYPACKAGE ONLY KEYS ~~\r\n    # everything above this was fairly standard, below are pypackage-specific features\r\n\r\n    # test_runner can be one of three strings, \"nose\", \"pytest\", or \"unittest\"\r\n    # if provided, pypackage will handle gathering and executing your tests via\r\n    # automatic methods of whatever runner you prefer. to run your tests with\r\n    # a test_runner in use, you can either use `py-test` or `py-build -s` to\r\n    # create the `setup.py` and run `python setup.py test` with that.\r\n    \"test_runner\": \"pytest\",\r\n\r\n    # tests_dir can be used to provide the directory which contains the tests,\r\n    # if automatic discovery does not work for your layout\r\n    \"tests_dir\": \"tests\",\r\n\r\n    # runner_args are arguments provided to your test_runner, if you need to\r\n    # use custom flags, perhaps to output a JUnit XML or what have you.
