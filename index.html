<p>Pypackage is a collection of python packaging applications including:</p>

<pre><code>py-build
py-develop
py-info
py-install
py-setup
py-test
</code></pre>

<p>The goal of Pypackage is to make python packaging easier and faster.</p>

<p>Wouldn't it be nice if you could just write some python, run a command,
and have a distributable package?</p>

<p>Well, now you can!</p>

<h2>
<a id="features" class="anchor" href="#features" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Features</h2>

<ul>
<li>  automatic detection of python modules and packages</li>
<li>  automatic inclusion of non-python package data files, and their
inclusion in and writing of the <code>MANIFEST.in</code>
</li>
<li>  support for three different testing frameworks (pytest, nose,
and unittest) for use with <code>setup.py test</code>
</li>
<li>  automatic script detection (any executable file in <code>./bin</code> or
<code>./scripts</code>)</li>
<li>  automatic <code>version</code>, <code>author</code>, <code>maintainer</code> and <code>email</code> (s)
detection (prefers <code>__init__.py</code>, <code>__version__.py</code>)</li>
<li>  curses front-end to python classifiers selection</li>
<li>  easy access to package metadata with <code>py-info &lt;package&gt;</code>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<a id="example-hello-world-application" class="anchor" href="#example-hello-world-application" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Example: "Hello World" application:</h2>

<pre lang="sourceCode"><code>$ mkdir hello_world
$ cd hello_world
$ vim hello_world.py   # write your python here... :)
$ py-build -is
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>py-build -is</code> command will take you through an interactive
<code>py-build</code> session, and then save the <code>setup.py</code> to disk (but it will
not run it).</p>

<p>You can use <code>py-setup</code> at any time to see what Pypackage would use as a
<code>setup.py</code> in the current directory's context.</p>

<p>Metadata can be mixed in with site-wide defaults from
<code>$HOME/.pypackage</code>, if you want to fill in some common attributes for
all your projects.</p>

<p>Pypackage can also find and run your tests with <code>python setup.py test</code>.
It supports three different test runners: pytest, nose, and unittest.</p>

<p>To be clear: pypackage does <em>not</em> replace setuptools, pip, or anything
in the python packaging tool-chain; it only attempts to complement those
utilities, and make python packaging a little easier.</p>

<p>In my perfect utopian dream world, I'd see projects not have a
<code>setup.py</code> under source control. Instead there would only be a static
metadata file. In the distribution version of the package, the inverse
would be true.</p>

<h2>
<a id="example-write-python-and-send-it-to-pypi" class="anchor" href="#example-write-python-and-send-it-to-pypi" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Example, write Python and send it to PyPI</h2>

<p>First, <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/distutils/packageindex.html#pypirc">configure your ~/.pypirc
file</a> with
a <code>[pypi]</code> section if you haven't already. Now, assuming you lay out
your project something like:</p>

<pre><code>./your_project
./your_project/README.md
./your_project/pypackage.meta
./your_project/...
./your_project/your_project/__init__.py
./your_project/your_project/your_code.py
./your_project/your_project/...
</code></pre>

<p>With pypackage installed, from <code>./your_project</code> run the following
commands to send your project to PyPI for the first time:</p>

<pre lang="sourceCode"><code>$ py-build
$ py-build -s
$ python setup.py register
$ twine upload dist/* || pip install twine &amp;&amp; twine upload dist/*
</code></pre>

<p>Every time after that, to update your package is a two step process:</p>

<pre lang="sourceCode"><code>$ py-build
$ twine upload dist/*
</code></pre>

<p>This will upload a binary wheel and source distribution to PyPI, so you
can share your work with the world.</p>

<p>The source distribution will include a <code>setup.py</code> and will not include
the <code>pypackage.meta</code> if you use one. In this way, Pypackage does not
create a build dependency on your distribution, but rather only on your
source, or perhaps more specifically, your build chain and/or
development environment. (Unless you choose to develop off of the
distributed source version, then carry on doing your thing.)</p>

<p>Just don't submit any patches to the <code>setup.py</code>, because it's not a real
thing in the source. As a project maintainer, you may even consider
adding <code>setup.py</code> to the <code>.gitignore</code> of your pypackaged projects.</p>

<h2>
<a id="pypackagemeta" class="anchor" href="#pypackagemeta" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>pypackage.meta</h2>

<p>Pypackage uses the <code>pypackage.meta</code> file in your project to fill in any
details that it would otherwise not be able to guess. It is a JSON
formatted file which can have any of the <code>setuptools</code> or <code>distutils</code>
setup kwargs as key/value pairs.</p>

<p>It also has a few extra keys to extend the functionality of setuptools
(most notably to support the <code>source_label</code> and <code>source_url</code> parameters,
mentioned in <a href="http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0426/">PEP426</a>).</p>

<p>Below is an example of a fully-featured <code>pypackage.meta</code> file. (For a
complete list of all available keys, they are the <code>_KEYS</code> and
<code>_PYPACKAGE_KEYS</code> OrderedDicts found in the <code>Config</code> object; <a href="https://github.com/ccpgames/pypackage/blob/master/pypackage/config.py">view the

<p>If your OS can run a bash script, execute <code>demo.sh</code> in the top level of
this repo to create a new pypackage venv and some simple example
packages in an <code>example</code> directory. From there feel free to play around
and experiment with pypackage features and applications.</p>
